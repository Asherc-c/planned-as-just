You need to run this everytime you start Muse Dash, because it is just a simple memory modifying.

You can manually patch `GameAssembly.dll` through Hex Editor if you want to make it permanent for a while, Until next official patches.

# 8/2/2023
Added `GameAssembly.dll` patcher, you just have to put the original `GameAssembly.dll` in the same folder as `patch_ga.py` then it will generate `GameAssembly_patched.dll` and put it in Muse Dash directory.
Currently doesn't have Wildcard Bytes support (cuz im skill issue ðŸ˜­)
